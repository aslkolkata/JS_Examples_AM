/* Object Oriented Programming in JS
   Encapsulation
   Abstraction
   Inheritance
   Polymorphism

   Variables and function(method) are group together ==> Encapsulation
   Hide some of the property from outside ==> Abstraction
   reuse of code; eleminate redundant code ==> inheritance
   Poly (means Many), Morphism (means form)
   Runtime select the actual/correct function (have same in different class) depending on the object reference
